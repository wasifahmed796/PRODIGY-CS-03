Password Strength Checker

This Python script assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria, including length, character diversity, and complexity.

Installation:

Ensure Python is installed: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website. Â  
Clone the repository: If you've cloned this repository, navigate to the project directory.
Usage:

Run the script: Execute the Python script:

Bash
python password_strength_checker.py
Use code with caution.

Enter password: The script will prompt you to enter a password.

Get feedback: The script will analyze the password and provide feedback on its strength.

How it works:

Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
Character Diversity: Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Strength Assessment: Categorizes the password as strong, medium, or weak based on the number of criteria met.
Customization:

Minimum Length: You can adjust the minimum required length by modifying the script's logic.
Complexity Criteria: You can add more complex criteria, such as avoiding common password patterns or dictionary words.
Feedback Messages: You can customize the feedback messages to provide more specific guidance.
Security Considerations:

Password Storage: Never store passwords in plain text. Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 to securely store password hashes.
Input Validation: Implement input validation to prevent malicious input and potential security vulnerabilities.
By following these guidelines and considering additional security best practices, you can create a robust and secure password strength checker.
